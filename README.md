### Prediction for Mashable News Popularity (in `projects/Popularity/`)

A supervised learning project where I:
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis.
- Fit and compare multiple models (e.g. linear/logistic regression, regularization methods, tree-based models).
- Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (RMSE, accuracy, ROC/AUC, etc.).
- Summarize findings in an R Markdown report.
